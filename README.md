## BansheeTap

## Introduction
BansheeTap is a mobile application developed as part of the "Web and hybrid technologies in mobile programming" course. It's designed to detect and log unintended or "ghost" touches on a device's screen. The primary intent behind BansheeTap is to provide a tool that aids in Mechanical and Environmental validation and testing of the device.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of BansheeTap is to assist in identifying, logging, and analyzing unintended screen touches, commonly known as "ghost touches". This is especially crucial in environments where screen precision and reliability are important. 
## Usage
BansheeTap is intended for private professional use. While the source code is made publicly available for educational and reference purposes, the application in its entirety is not intended for widespread public distribution for now.

## Features
- **Touch Event Logging**: Records touch events with timestamps and coordinates.
- **Maintenance Mode**: Allows for user interaction without logging touch events and causing abnormalities in log files.
- **Data Storage and Exporting**: Recorded log files are saved in device storage and can be exported with installed applications and directly to Firebase.
- **Heatmap**: Heatmap allows the user to analyze the data by viewing the recorded touch points onscreen.
