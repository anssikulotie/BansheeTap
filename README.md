## BansheeTap

## Introduction and the purpose of the application.
BansheeTap is a mobile application developed for the "Web and Hybrid Technologies in Mobile Programming" course. Its main purpose is to help users identify, log, and analyze unintended screen touches, known as "ghost touches". Addressing ghost touches is important part in developing high-quality mobile devices, which are suitable for use in challenging environments and professional use.

## Usage
BansheeTap is intended for private professional use. While the source code is made publicly available for educational and reference purposes, the application in its entirety is not intended for widespread public distribution for now.

## Features
- **Touch Event Logging**: Records touch events with timestamps and coordinates.
- **Maintenance Mode**: Allows for user interaction without logging touch events and causing abnormalities in log files.
- **Data Storage and Exporting**: Recorded log files are saved in device storage and can be exported with installed applications and directly to Firebase.
- **Heatmap**: Heatmap allows the user to analyze the data by viewing the recorded touch points on-screen.
